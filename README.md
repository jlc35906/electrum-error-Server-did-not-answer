# electrum-error-Server-did-not-answer
I am trying to send money on electrum and I input btc address in the send:payto section i leave the description blank and 
have tried various amts. of bitcoin to sendb but every time it says signing transaction, then it says broadcasting transaction
and then an error pops up that says error: Server did not answer.  My server is set to auto connect and the green light is on but
i cannot send anything and with almost 2 btc in there im  worried I'll lose it.
